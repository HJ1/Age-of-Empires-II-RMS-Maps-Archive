Random statements are used to specify an instruction running only part of the time. The random chance is specified as a percent (1-100). If the percents do not add up to 100, then the remaining percentage will apply towards a default setting. Everything between start_random and end_random is considered part of the same random instruction. Random statements can be nested inside each other.

/*
   Terrain is different from Land. Land is used to create something aside from the default terrain type, most typically islands of grass in water. Terrain includes features on that land, such as desert and forests. An important distinction is that land is placed down before elevation, but terrain is placed down after elevation. The order terrain is placed is also important. If you place palm desert on desert terrain before you place any desert terrain on the map, then you aren't going to see any palm trees. Remember, land is placed all at once. Terrain and objects are placed in order.
